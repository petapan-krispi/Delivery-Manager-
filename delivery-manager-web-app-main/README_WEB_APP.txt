If you get "Python not found" error:

- On Windows: Check "Add Python to PATH" during installation
- Restart your computer after installing Python

If you get "Package installation failed" error:
- Check your internet connection
- Try running the script again
- On Windows: Run Command Prompt as Administrator

If the browser doesn't open automatically:
- Manually go to http://localhost:8501
- Make sure no other application is using port 8501

If you get "Permission denied" on Mac/Linux:
- Run: chmod +x run_mac.sh run_linux.sh
- Or run: python3 -m streamlit run app.py

If the session ends quickly or you get errors:
1. Run the test script first: python test_app.py
2. Try the debug version: debug_run.bat (Windows)
3. Check if all packages are installed correctly
4. Make sure no antivirus is blocking the application

If you get "Session ended very soon after starting":
- This usually means there's an import error
- Run: python test_app.py to check for issues
- Try: debug_run.bat for detailed error messages
